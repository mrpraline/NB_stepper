# NB_stepper
Non-blocking arduino library for driving unipolar stepper motors directly. It is mainly intended for driving small can type motors like the 28BYJ-48. 

This is a fork of the CustomStepper library by Igor Campos. I removed all floating point math and added some functionality to make it easier to work with reference positions.
